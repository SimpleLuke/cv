I am a diligent and conscientious Full Stack Junior Developer looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge.

After graduating with a degree in Drama, I spent five years working in the performance and customer service industries. As a result, I became observant and improved my communication skills. To make good use of my intellectual side, I left my job and started to teach myself programming. In 2022, I joined the Makers Academy, a 16-week software development boot camp.

Tech Skills : JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, ExpressJs, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Self-Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices efficiently without guidance. Before the Makers course, I learned web development with JavaScript and React by myself and finished various solo projects.
- **Flexible** - Excited to meet new environments, languages, teams and challenges. I identify the same patterns underneath the changes and adjust to the specific circumstances.
- **Open-minded** - As an actor trained in performance art, I welcome any creative idea to approach a problem and learn from the differences.
- **Modest** - A strong believer for growth mindset. There is always a chance to improve. I always look for an opportunity to refactor and debug my code base.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and challenges boost me to become a better programmer and a better person.
- **Team-player** - With my performance and customer service experience, I always find my best role in a team because I believe we succeed as a team.
