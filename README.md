## <a name="about_me">About me üôã</a>

As a proactive, enthusiastic, and resilient **Full Stack Software Developer** with expertise in React, Node.js, and MongoDB, I am passionate about building innovative and user-friendly applications. You can find me bouldering, reading up on the latest tech trends, or learning a new language when I'm not coding.

As a former professional [theatre actor](https://youtu.be/cwZIPJxuqoM) (you will find me with a bald head in 0:20), I honed my skills in logical thinking and creative problem-solving, which has been invaluable in my journey to becoming a software developer.

As a professional theatre actor, I often felt limited in my ability to make a tangible impact on the world. However, through software development, I have found a way to channel my creativity and problem-solving skills towards creating valuable tools that can positively impact people's lives. It's amazing how with just my brain and a computer, I can turn an idea into a reality. I am excited to be a part of the revolution in technology, and I look forward to contributing my skills to develop solutions that address real-world problems.

I am looking to join a company committed to positively impacting society, whether through sustainable business practices or social responsibility initiatives. By working with like-minded individuals, I can contribute to building a happy and friendly community inside and outside the workplace.
