## <a name="about_me">About me üôã</a>

I am a recent graduate of Makers Coding Academy, with prior software development experience in front-end web development. I have a strong customer service background and am confident in contributing to and leading various teams. Additionally, I have experience managing the communication between clients and the relevant technical departments of a busy performance theatre.

As a former professional [theatre actor](https://youtu.be/cwZIPJxuqoM) (you will find me with a bald head in 0:20), I notice acting and software development are very similar. They combined arts and craftsmanship to bring people together. As a software developer and an actor, I turn innovative ideas into tangible software by putting my soul, youth and lower back pain.

Through software development, I have found a way to channel my creativity and problem-solving skills towards creating valuable tools that can positively impact people's lives. I believe good technologies bring people together!

I am excited to be a part of the revolution in technology.
